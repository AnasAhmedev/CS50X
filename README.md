# CS50x â€“ Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions and projects from Harvard's **CS50x** course. CS50x is an intensive introduction to computer science that covers fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. Throughout the course, I completed various problem sets and projects using **C, Python, SQL, and web development tools**.

## Key Learnings

### 1. C Programming
- Understanding variables, loops, and functions.
- Memory management and pointers.
- Data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues.

### 2. Algorithms
- Implementing searching and sorting algorithms (binary search, bubble sort, merge sort, etc.).
- Analyzing algorithm efficiency and Big-O notation.

### 3. Python & SQL
- Writing Python scripts and working with data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets).
- Using SQL to manage and query databases.

### 4. Web Development
- Basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Building Flask applications.

### 5. Cybersecurity & Ethics
- Understanding vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.
- Ethical considerations in computer science.

## Conclusion
CS50x has been an amazing journey, strengthening my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of computer science fundamentals. I'm excited to apply this knowledge in future projects!
